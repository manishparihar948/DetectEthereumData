# DetectEthereumData
Study ethereum transaction data behaviour and design pattern
In this study, we want to explore the Ethereum network transactional data in examination of incongruous behavior or an irrational exertion in the network. Many compositions are accessible for an unexpected disclosure in various network and sys- tem configuration. We have selected appropriate machine learning approaches for doing this.

Can we detect incongruous acts in the Ethereum Transaction Network using machine learning algorithms ?
